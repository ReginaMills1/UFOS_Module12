Module 12: UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to present UFO sighting data in a visually appealing webpage. JavaScript was used to display and filter the data based on the date, location, and shape of the UFO sighted.
## Results

The webpage is very interactive as users can enter a date, city, state, country, or shape to see what UFO Sightings have been recorded. The table should update automatically. See Figure 1.

Dates should be entered using the (M/DD/YYYY) format. For example, "1/9/2010" will show results, but "01/09/2010" wont. Cities, states, countries, and shapes should all be entered in lower case. The table will display no data if these conventions are not followed. See Figures 2 and 3 for examples of correct vs incorrect date entries.

The filter tool allows for multiple entries, see Figure 4 for spheres observed on 1/10/2010.

## Summary
The tool is interactive and the webpage is appealing, but there are some cons to this website. The filters are rigid with regards to spelling, capitalization, and date entry. User errors will result in no data displayed.

I would recommend that this tool is further developed to allow for variation of ways to enter date, city, state, and country entry.  Users can get furstrated by the filter search's strict capitalization and date entry rules.
